This repo hosts the source code of the website. It's built with Jekyll.
This README is an onboarding document. If you find anything to be updated, including
this README, please make a branch and a PR.

By building a website with Jekyll and hosting as a Github page, we don't have to worry
about traditional web development. Ideally, we only have to modify markdown files.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Ruby, Jekyll, and Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
1. In the root repo directory, install the necessary gems by running `bundle install`.

## Run the website locally

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl /`
1. Type http://127.0.0.1:4000/ on your web browser.
